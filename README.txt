Keyring for webOS
Easy password management on your phone

Keyring for webOS stores your account information securely, so you don't
have to rely on your memory, or on little scraps of paper. Sensitive data
are encrypted using the Blowfish algorithm, and protected by a master password.

Available (for now) at the PreCentral Homebrew App Gallery:

http://www.precentral.net/homebrew-apps/keyring

Hopefully soon in the Palm App Store...
